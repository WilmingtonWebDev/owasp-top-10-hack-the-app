# Hack The Web

This page is part of Wilmington Web Devs OWASP Top 10 Talks.

Hack-the-App is a 2 hour workshop where we aim to try and apply some of the techniques we learned at the previous OWASP Top 10 talk.

For the workshop we'll be deploying the OWASP Juice Shop App which guarantees us that the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilites are present and ready to be exploited.

For more information on deploying the app yourself and a list of tools that may help you run pentests against it head over to [the wiki](https://github.com/WilmingtonWebDev/owasp-top-10-hack-the-app/wiki)

NOTE: This repo is still beign update. It you have any suggestions raise an [Issue](https://github.com/WilmingtonWebDev/owasp-top-10-hack-the-app/issues), or even better fork the repo and submit a pull request.
